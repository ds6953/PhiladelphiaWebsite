    <h1>Eastern City Penitentiary</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Eastern State Penitentiary, also known as ESP, is a former American prison in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[6] It is located at 2027 Fairmount Avenue between Corinthian Avenue and North 22nd Street in the Fairmount section of the city, and was operational from 1829 until 1971. The penitentiary refined the revolutionary system of separate incarceration first pioneered at the Walnut Street Jail which emphasized principles of reform rather than punishment.[7</p>
    <p>Notorious criminals such as Al Capone and bank robber Willie Sutton were held inside its innovative wagon wheel design. James Bruno (Big Joe) and several male relatives were incarcerated here between 1936 and 1948 for the alleged murders in the Kelayres massacre of 1934, before they were paroled.[8] At its completion, the building was the largest and most expensive public structure ever erected in the United States,[9] and quickly became a model for more than 300 prisons worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics:</h2>

    <p>Equally notable for its architecture and mechanical advances, Eastern State served as the structural and ideological model for more than 300 prisons around the world. In architect John Haviland's radial design, cellblocks of the prison extend outward from a central surveillance area.</p>

    <h2>Location:</h2>

    <p>Located in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia. The address is 30 Institution Road Napanoch, New York</p>
